This repository has five Jupyter notebooks about active learning and visualizations of the training.

bin_1_increased_training_data: Tests how adding more training data improves model accuracy.
bin_2_Compare_CIFAR: Compares different active learning methods on the CIFAR dataset and checks against a baseline.
bin_2_Compare_MNIST: Same as the bin_2_compare_CIFAR notebook but uses MNIST data set instead.
bin_3_plot_CIFAR: Creates graphs to show active learning results for CIFAR, including baseline accuracy.
bin_3_plot_MNIST: Same as the bin_3_plot_CIFAR notebook but uses MNIST data set instead.
